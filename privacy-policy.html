      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

      <p>
        Treviño Law respects your privacy and is committed to
        protecting the personal information you provide through this website. This Privacy Policy
        explains how we collect, use, safeguard, and disclose information obtained from website
        visitors and individuals who contact us through online forms or other electronic means.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using this website, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, including but not
        limited to your name, phone number, email address, and information related to your legal
        inquiry or circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are not required to provide personal information; however, choosing not to provide
        certain information may limit our ability to respond to your inquiry or provide requested
        services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also collect limited non-personal information automatically when you visit our
        website, such as IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, and time spent
        on the site. This information is used for analytics, security, and website improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        The information we collect may be used to respond to inquiries, evaluate potential legal
        matters, communicate regarding our services, improve website functionality, enhance security,
        and maintain internal records.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treviño Law does not sell, rent, lease, or trade personal information to third parties for
        marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        Submitting information through this website, including through contact forms, emails, or
        phone calls, does not create an attorney-client relationship. An attorney-client relationship
        is established only through a signed written agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do not submit confidential or time-sensitive information unless and until an
        attorney-client relationship has been formally established.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies & Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        This website may use cookies or similar technologies to enhance functionality, analyze
        traffic, and improve user experience. Cookies do not provide access to personally identifiable
        information beyond what you voluntarily provide.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may use third-party services such as analytics tools, mapping services, or social media
        integrations. These providers operate under their own privacy policies, which are not under
        the control of Treviño Law.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>
        Information may be disclosed only as necessary to respond to your inquiry, comply with legal
        obligations, protect the rights or safety of the Firm, or work with service providers under
        confidentiality obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your
        information. However, no method of electronic transmission or data storage is completely
        secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>External Links</h2>
      <p>
        This website may contain links to third-party websites. Treviño Law is not responsible for the
        content, security, or privacy practices of those websites. We encourage users to review the
        privacy policies of any external sites they visit.
